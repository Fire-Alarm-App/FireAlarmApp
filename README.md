# Fire Alarm App

This is the PWA for our Fire Alarm App.
Currently, the system has an express server with the necessary endpoints to
create web push notifications and subscribe to the server. We have an initial UI
built for the app. 

We are working on implementing the rest of the features, mainly being the 
User authentication and the UI.
